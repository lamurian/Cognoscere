# Determine fit-for-purpose dataset

- Feasibility:
  - Data elements: What included in the dataset
  - Counts: The frequency of entries
  - Timings: The time of occurrence for each outcome of interest
- Capacity: Willingness to participate
- Validity: Quality of data for specific exposures or outcomes

# Phenotyping in federated European RWD

- Purpose: Finding patients with certain disease and used particular medications
- The [phenotype](Resources/phenotype-in-medicine-and-data-science.md) is defined as a cohort with clinical manifestation of the outcome of interest
- Problem: Each country has different terminologies

# DARWIN EU phenotyping process

- A federated network o fdata, expertise, and services that generates reliable evidence
- DARWIN EU^[https://darwin-eu.org/] provides standardized tools and pipelines
