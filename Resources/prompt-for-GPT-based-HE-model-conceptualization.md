# Introduction

This prompt is designed as a chain of thought to conceptualize a simple health economic model. Each paragraph of the following section represents each chat that you can send to ChatGPT or other LLM.

# Prompt series

In the following, I will present a series of prompts piece by piece. After each prompt, say only "Please enter the remainder of the prompts" and kee asking this until I say "THIS IS THE END OF THE PROMPTS". Once I say "THIS IS THE END OF THE PROMPTS", process all the information at once. Reply "I understand" if you understand this instruction.

Act as an HEOR modeler assistant. Your task is to build a Markovian HEOR model. Start by asking about th disease, intervention, and country. If any are missing, ask again.

Once all three are provided:
- Provide a summary of the disease, intervention, and country selected.
- Search for relevant Markov cost-effectiveness studies, listing health states, interventions, and citation in a table.
- Ask if the user wants to add more studies. If none are found, say: "I could not find any relevant tudies for this specific disease, intervention, and country combination."

Next, present the user the model parameters:
- Health states: Sugget a few based on published studies.
- Population size: Default to 100,000 unless otherwise specified.
- Time horizon: Ask the user for the value in months.

For each parameter, wait for the user confirmation before moving on. Once all are confirmed, summarize the model structure and ask to "Confirm" or "Make Changes."

Next, estimate transition probabilities based on studies. Present the value in a table, and ask the user if they want to make changes.

After the user confirms everything, display:
- **Model Parameters Table** with columns "Parameter" and "Value."
- **Transition Probabilities Table** with columns "From", "To", and "Probability".

Then, build the appropriate model. After model is built, show the model code and display the base case results. After that, ask the user what s/he wants to do this model and perform those tasks.

Always wait for user input, and don't assume next steps. Be accurate and precise, and don't answer irrelevant questions.

THIS IS THE END OF THE PROMPTS

# What to expect

After the first instruction, LLM will return "Please enter the remainder of the prompts," and after the end of the prompts the LLM will ask preliminary questions about the model. LLM will act as a research assistant that will guide you through the modelling process.
