# Comparison table

Here’s a comparison table of several **valid and simple well-being measures** that are **short (less than or equal to 10 questions)** and suitable for the **general population** to track their well-being. These tools focus on various aspects of mental health and life satisfaction, from general well-being to emotional states.

| **Instrument**            | **Intended Use Case**                           | **Number of Questions** | **Specificity**      | **Sensitivity**       | **Frequency of Use**            |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Single Item Well-Being (SWB)** | General life satisfaction and well-being | 1                       | Low (very general)    | High (easy to complete) | **Daily/Weekly** (for general monitoring) |
| **Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS)** | Measures happiness and life satisfaction | 4                       | Moderate (captures happiness broadly) | High (focuses on overall happiness) | **Weekly/Monthly** |
| **The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)** | Measures emotional balance (positive vs negative emotions) | 10                      | High (distinguishes positive/negative emotions) | High (focuses on emotional well-being) | **Weekly/Monthly** (to track emotional states) |
| **Flourish (PERMA Profiler)** | Assesses key well-being factors (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment) | 15 (but can be shortened) | High (holistic measure) | Moderate (reflects a broad range of well-being) | **Monthly** (to evaluate all aspects of well-being) |
| **The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS)** | Measures mental well-being, with an emphasis on positive functioning | 14 (short form 7-item version) | Moderate to High (emphasis on positive mental health) | High (focus on flourishing rather than deficits) | **Monthly** |
| **Cantril’s Ladder (Self-Rated Well-Being)** | Measures current life satisfaction on a scale | 1                       | Low (broad measure)   | High (simple and straightforward) | **Daily/Weekly** (for monitoring life satisfaction) |
| **EQ-5D (VAS and Descriptive System)** | Measures overall health and well-being across 5 dimensions | 5 (descriptive) + 1 (VAS) | Moderate (measures health, not emotions) | Moderate (captures general health-related quality of life) | **Monthly/Quarterly** (to track general health-related well-being) |
| **Short Depression and Anxiety Scale (SDAS)** | Measures symptoms of depression and anxiety (focuses on emotional health) | 5                       | High (focused on emotional distress) | High (focused on symptoms of distress) | **Weekly/Monthly** (if emotional health is a concern) |

# **Explanation of Key Columns:**

- **Number of Questions**: The number of questions in the instrument, focusing on brevity.
- **Specificity**: The ability of the tool to measure a specific aspect of well-being or health (e.g., emotional distress, happiness, life satisfaction).
- **Sensitivity**: The responsiveness of the tool to detect changes in well-being or emotions over time.
- **Frequency of Use**: Suggested frequency for use depending on the purpose (daily for tracking trends, weekly for short-term monitoring, monthly for longer-term reflection).

# **Summary Recommendations:**

- **For daily monitoring** of general well-being or life satisfaction, **Cantril’s Ladder** (1 question) and **SWB** (1 question) are excellent for quick check-ins.
- **For emotional balance** (positive vs negative emotions), **PANAS** (10 questions) is a good option, although slightly longer.
- **For a more holistic approach** to mental well-being across different domains, consider the **PERMA Profiler** or the **Flourish** measure (though the full version is a bit longer than 10 items).
- If you're looking for something even shorter, the **Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS)** (4 questions) provides a simple but effective measure of happiness.
