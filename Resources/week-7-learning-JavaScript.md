- Focus: Style the patient data widget.  
  - Use Tailwind CSS or Material-UI components to create a styled patient list.  
- Task: Style the `PatientList` component with grid or table layouts for better data presentation.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Implement interactive elements.  
  - Style buttons, dropdowns, and form inputs (search bar, filters).  
  - Make the widget responsive using media queries or Tailwind's responsive classes.  
- Task: Add a search bar and filter buttons with relevant styling.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review the widget's appearance, ensuring it looks polished and cohesive.

# Day 3: Advanced Styling Techniques (3 hours)  

## Goal: Use advanced CSS techniques for improved UI/UX.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Tailwind CSS advanced utilities or Material-UI customizations.  
  - Learn how to customize themes, typography, colors, and spacing.  
- Task: Modify the default theme of Tailwind or Material-UI to match your app’s branding.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Animations and transitions.  
  - Explore how to add animations or transitions to elements (e.g., hover effects, modal popups).  
- Task: Add a subtle hover effect to buttons and cards.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Working with icons.  
  - Learn to use icon libraries like FontAwesome, Heroicons (for Tailwind), or Material-UI icons.  
- Task: Add icons to buttons or tables for better user interaction.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test the UI responsiveness and refine animations or transitions.

# Day 4: Performance Optimization: Code Splitting and Lazy Loading (3 hours)  

## Goal: Optimize your app’s performance with code splitting and lazy loading.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Introduction to code splitting.  
  - Learn how React’s lazy loading works.  
  - Use `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` to dynamically load components.  
- Task: Split your components into separate chunks to improve initial load time (e.g., `PatientList`, `PatientDetail`).  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Implement lazy loading for routes.  
  - Use `React Router` with lazy-loaded components.  
- Task: Apply lazy loading to different routes in your app to speed up the initial page load.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Bundle optimization with Vite.  
  - Learn how to optimize your bundle size using Vite’s built-in features like tree shaking.  
- Task: Analyze the bundle size and implement optimization strategies (e.g., removing unused code, externalizing libraries).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test your app’s performance improvements.  
  - Use Chrome DevTools or Lighthouse to measure the impact of your optimizations.

# Day 5: Performance Optimization: Caching and Image Optimization (3 hours)  

## Goal: Optimize the loading time of images and assets.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Image optimization techniques.  
  - Learn about image formats (e.g., WebP, SVG) and lazy loading for images.  
- Task: Implement image optimization for your widgets (e.g., use WebP for images).  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Caching strategies.  
  - Understand how to use Service Workers or browser caching for static assets.  
- Task: Set up caching headers for your assets and try to implement a basic Service Worker.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Audit your app's assets.  
  - Use tools like Lighthouse to detect unoptimized images or scripts.  
- Task: Optimize any remaining unoptimized images or scripts.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test the app’s loading speed with Lighthouse, ensuring faster performance.
