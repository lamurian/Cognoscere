# Week 3: React Fundamentals Pomodoro Planner

This week focuses on learning React basics, props, state, and event handling while building practical, hands-on projects. We'll allocate Pomodoros for learning and applying these concepts in small, manageable steps.

# Day 1: Setting Up React and JSX Basics (3 hours)  

## Goal: Set up a React environment and understand JSX.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Setting up React.  
  - Install Node.js if not already installed.  
  - Set up a React project using `create-react-app` or Vite.  
- Task: Create a starter project and run it locally.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Introduction to JSX.  
  - Learn how JSX allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript.  
  - Understand JSX rules (e.g., wrapping multiple elements, self-closing tags).  
- Task: Write a simple React component that renders your name in an `<h1>` tag.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Practice: Build a simple "Hello, World!" React app.  
  - Modify the app to display a custom greeting with the current date and time.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review and refine your setup. Explore the project structure and key files (e.g., `App.js`, `index.js`).

# Day 2: Function Components and Props (3 hours)  

## Goal: Learn to create reusable components and use props.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Writing functional components.  
  - Understand the syntax for defining a function component.  
  - Learn how to render a component inside another.  
- Task: Create a `Greeting` component that displays a custom message.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Passing data with props.  
  - Learn how to pass data to a component using props.  
- Task: Create a `UserCard` component that displays a user’s name and email passed as props.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Practice: Create a reusable `Button` component.  
  - Pass the button label as a prop.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review and experiment with combining components and props in different ways.

# Day 3: State with useState (3 hours)  

## Goal: Understand and manage state in React components.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Introduction to state with `useState`.  
  - Learn how to declare state variables.  
  - Understand how state updates re-render the component.  
- Task: Create a counter component with buttons to increment and decrement a number.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Combining state and props.  
  - Pass the current state as a prop to child components.  
- Task: Create a parent component that manages state and a child component that displays it.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Practice: Add a reset button to the counter component to reset the count to zero.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review `useState` usage and debug any issues.

# Day 4: Event Handling (3 hours)  

## Goal: Handle user interactions like clicks and inputs.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Event handling basics.  
  - Learn how to handle `onClick` and `onChange` events in React.  
- Task: Create a button that toggles text between “ON” and “OFF” when clicked.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Controlled components.  
  - Learn how to handle form inputs by tying input value to state.  
- Task: Create a simple form that displays the entered text below it in real-time.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Practice: Build a small app where clicking a button changes the background color of the page.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test and refine your event-handling logic.  

---

# Day 5: API Integration and Fetching Data (3 hours)  

## Goal: Fetch and display data from an API in a React app.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Fetching data with `fetch()` in React.  
  - Learn where to place API calls in a React component.  
- Task: Fetch and display a list of posts from JSONPlaceholder.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Displaying API data.  
  - Use `.map()` to dynamically render data as a list of components.  
- Task: Create a `PostCard` component to display each post's title and body.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Enhancements: Add error handling for failed API calls.  
  - Display a loading spinner while fetching data.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test your app and refine the UI.  

---

# Day 6: Mini React Project (3 hours)  

## Goal: Build a React app combining all concepts.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Setup: Plan and design a small React app (e.g., a "User Directory" app).  
  - Fetch user data from an API (e.g., https://randomuser.me/).  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Implementation: Build the app structure.  
  - Display user data using reusable components.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Enhancements: Add interactivity.  
  - Include a search bar to filter users by name.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review, test, and document the app.  

---

# Day 7: Review and Consolidation (3 hours)  

## Goal: Reinforce knowledge and clean up projects.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Review React basics, props, and state concepts.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Add comments and refactor code in your projects.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Optional: Expand a project (e.g., add more features or improve styling).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Plan next week's focus and projects based on progress.
