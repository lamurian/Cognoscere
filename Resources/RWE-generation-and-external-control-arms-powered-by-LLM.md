# Role of AI

- Unlock more data for external control arms
  - Structuring unstructured data
  - Generate synthetic data based on real-world data
- Optimize model building
  - Review clinical trial protocols and eligibility criteria
  - Compute patient similarity, e.g. using propensity scoring
  - Construct the initial model
  - Analyze and enhance the initial model
- [Improve patient matching with the eligibility criteria](Resources/regulatory-landscape-for-real-world-data-and-external-control-arm-worldwide.md)
