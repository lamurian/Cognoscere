# Resources

FHIR is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It’s more specialized compared to the other technologies, but here are some resources to get you started:

- [HL7 FHIR Official Documentation](https://hl7.org/fhir/): The official documentation is the best place to start. It’s detailed and covers all aspects of FHIR, from the basics to more advanced concepts.
- [FHIR DevDays YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FHIRDevDays): A collection of videos and presentations from FHIR DevDays conferences, where experts share insights and tutorials on FHIR.
- [SMART on FHIR Tutorial](https://docs.smarthealthit.org/tutorials/): SMART on FHIR is a framework that builds on FHIR to provide standardized, secure access to data in healthcare systems. This tutorial is a great way to understand how FHIR can be implemented in real-world applications.
- [FHIR University](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/standards-technology/standards/fhir-university): Free online courses from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) to learn about FHIR and its implementation.
