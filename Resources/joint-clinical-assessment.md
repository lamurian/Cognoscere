- Three independent domains of certainty:
  - Internal validity: Systematic error
  - Statistical precision: Random sample variation
  - External validity: Generalisability
- Certainty of results needs to be described in an objective, reproducible, and transparent way
- Certainty of results is independent of the medical PICO context
- Element of uncertainty:
  - Probability
  - Ambiguity
  - Complexity
