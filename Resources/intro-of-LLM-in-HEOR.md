# History of AI

- 1950: Turing test, symbolic and rule-based approach, Eliza, MYCIN
- 1990: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Networks
- 2010: Deep learning, e.g. CNN, RNN, LSTM
- 2020: Generative AI

In a nutshell, language model is a probabilistic model to estimate the probability distribution of the next word given historical words. LLM relies on a transformer-based pre-trained language models with billions of parameters. Transformer model is an encoder-decoder neural network. Given large enough numbers of parameters, we can expect the leap in machine understanding.

# LLM application in healthcare

- Transform multiple input/output modals, e.g. from text to speech, text to image, etc.
- Summarizing key findings and important notes
- Aid in providing differential diagnoses
