- CARD15 gene has polymorphic features
- It has been [associated](Resources/the-etiology-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease.md) with [IBD](Resources/inflammatory-bowel-disease.md) 
- CARD15 gene can't determine which part of the GI tract will be affected
- The role is stronger in [CD](Resources/Crohn-disease.md) than [UC](Resources/ulcerative-colitis.md)
