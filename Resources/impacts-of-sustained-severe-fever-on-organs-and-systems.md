A sustained and severely elevated fever can cause lethal impacts to:

# Brain

Acute neurologic and cognitive function may occur **after an episode of hyperthermia**, with approximately 50% of heatstroke survivors experiencing chronic neurologic damage. Specifically, the  [**Purkinje cells**](Resources/Purkinje-cells.md) in the cerebellar cortex are sensitive to heat damage, which can lead to long-lasting cerebellar dysfunction.

# Cardiovascular

Acutely, a hyperthermic patient will tend to be hypotensive with a high cardiac output due to blood redistribution and nitric#oxide#induced vasoconstriction. In severe fever, such as heatstroke, an electrocardiogram may show T#wave abnormalities, QT and ST changes, and conduction defects. In addition, serum troponin I levels may be significantly raised.

# Gastrointestinal

Above 40 C (104 F), there is a reduction in blood flow to the GI tract. In addition, oxidative stress, denatured proteins, and damaged cell membranes are evident, increasing the potential for releasing pro#inflammatory cytokines, GI inflammation, and edema.

# Liver

Elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) are observed in individuals with body temperatures above 40 C, with severe cases leading to permanent hepatocellular damage requiring a liver transplant. It is important to note that liver function may continue to decline even after correcting hyperthermia. For this reason, a clinician should trend the patient's liver enzymes to ensure no ongoing liver damage exists.

# Kidney

Patients with an increased body temperature are at a significantly greater risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). An increase in body temperature by only 2 C leads to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which continues to fall with a further rise in temperature. Lab studies will show an increase in plasma creatinine and urea. Additionally, a hyperthermic state stimulates the renin#angiotensin#aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to a subsequent reduction in blood flow to the kidney.

# Hemostasis

Inhibition of platelet aggregation, spontaneous bleeding, increased clotting times, thrombocytopenia, and increased plasma fibrin degradation productions are classically seen in hyperthermic patients.
