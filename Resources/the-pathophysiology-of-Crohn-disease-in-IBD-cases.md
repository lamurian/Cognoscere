- There is a skip lesion, *viz.* a part of the GI tract that is not affected by inflammation
- It affects any segments of the GI tract
- CD may induce strictures, inflammation, or fistula development
- CD involves all layers of the bowel, i.e. transmural
- Linear ulcers between the normal mucosa will appear as a cobblestone appearance during later phase of the disease
- CD mostly affects the colon and ileum
  - In 5% of patients: CD affects the esophago-gastro-duodenal segments
  - Pediatric-onset cases have greater upper GI involvement
  - CD causes the malabsorption of bile salts and fatty acids $\to$ Lead to kidney diseases and gallstones
- CD spares the rectum, so we can expect no inflammation there
- However, anorectal complications like fistulas and abscesses are expected
- CD predisposes extraintestinal involvements:
  - Arthritis
  - Aphthous stomatitis
  - Uveitis
  - Erythema nodosum
  - Ankylosing spndyloarthropathy
