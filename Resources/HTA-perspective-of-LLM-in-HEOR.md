# AI for evidence generation

- There are concerns about appropriateness, transparency, and trustworthiness
- Anticipated benefits must be balanced against concerns
- Any use of AI should support the needs of users $\to$ Detailed technical guidance is urgently needed
- Further guidance is needed to present evidence informed by AI methods

# NICE AI position statement

- This statement aims to:
  - Outline what NICE expects when AI methods are used for evidence generation and reporting
  - Indicate existing regulations, good practices, standards and guidelines to follow when using AI methods, where appropriate
  - Support NICE committee members and external assessment groups about the potential uses of AI methods
- AI should only be used when there is demonstrable value from doing so $\to$ To balance the risks and benefits
- Justify the use of AI, common methods should be used in the first instance
- Use of AI should align to government framework for regulating AI and/or other ethical frameworks
- AI user must ensure that the use of AI is fit for purpose and meet ethical, technical, scientific, and regulatory standards
- Always involve human experts in the loop
- AI users should clearly state the use of AI: Explain what was used, where/how/why it has been used
- Need to implement robust security measures
