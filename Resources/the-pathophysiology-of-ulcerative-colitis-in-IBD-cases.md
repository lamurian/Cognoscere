- Mucosal inflammation always happens
- Cause edema, ulcers, bleeding, and electrolyte loses
- Inflammation starts in the rectum and progresses without interruption (continuously) to the proximal colon
- In 20% of patients: The disease remains confined to the rectum
- In 15% of patients: Pancolitis occurs
- In chronic disorder:
  - The colon becomes more rigid and short
  - Loss of haustral markings $\to$ Lead-pipe appearance on a barium enema
- UC predisposes extraintestinal involvement on the skin, eyes, and bones:
  - Inflammatory arthropathies
  - Primary sclerosing cholangitis
