# 1. MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview)

- Description: The MINI is a short, structured diagnostic interview designed to diagnose DSM and ICD disorders. It is typically clinician-administered but can sometimes be adapted for self-administration.
- Sensitivity & Specificity:
  - The MINI is a diagnostic tool, not a symptom severity tool, which gives it a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD).
  - Studies report sensitivity > 90% and specificity > 85% for depression when compared to the SCID (gold standard).
- Strengths:
  - It closely aligns with diagnostic criteria, making it the most accurate for identifying clinical depression.
- Limitations:
  - Requires a clinician or trained individual to administer.
  - Time-intensive compared to other tools.
  - Less suited for ongoing symptom monitoring.

Conclusion: Best for diagnostic accuracy but less practical for routine assessment due to complexity.

# 2. PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)

- Description: A brief, self-administered tool designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms based on DSM criteria. It is commonly used in primary care and research settings.
- Sensitivity & Specificity:
  - A meta-analysis found the PHQ-9 to have a pooled sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 85% for detecting MDD at the optimal cutoff score (commonly ≥10).
  - Sensitivity and specificity vary slightly with cutoff thresholds:
    - Lower cutoff (≥8): Higher sensitivity but lower specificity.
    - Higher cutoff (≥12): Higher specificity but lower sensitivity.
- Strengths:
  - Quick, easy to administer, and validated for diverse populations.
  - Effective for monitoring changes in symptoms over time.
- Limitations:
  - May miss atypical or nuanced presentations of depression.
  - Scores are influenced by subjective self-reporting biases.

Conclusion: High sensitivity and specificity, particularly for screening in primary care. Excellent for frequent monitoring.

# 3. HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale)

- Description: A 14-item self-report tool with two subscales for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). Developed for use in hospital settings but widely applied elsewhere.
- Sensitivity & Specificity:
  - The depression subscale (HADS-D) typically has a sensitivity of 70–90% and specificity of 70–85% for detecting depressive disorders at a cutoff of ≥8.
  - Less robust when compared to PHQ-9 or MINI in non-clinical populations.
- Strengths:
  - Good for identifying comorbid anxiety and depression in medical populations.
  - Avoids physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite) to focus on psychological aspects.
- Limitations:
  - Not as directly tied to DSM diagnostic criteria.
  - May underperform in general populations or settings outside healthcare.

Conclusion: Useful in specialized settings but slightly lower sensitivity and specificity compared to PHQ-9 and MINI.

# 4. DASS-21 (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21)

- Description: A 21-item self-report scale with subscales for depression, anxiety, and stress. Measures symptom severity rather than diagnostic categories.
- Sensitivity & Specificity:
  - Studies report sensitivity of 79–91% and specificity of 77–82% for the depression subscale (cutoff scores vary).
  - Not explicitly designed to diagnose depression but correlates well with diagnostic tools.
- Strengths:
  - Measures overlapping dimensions (stress and anxiety), which can help in understanding comorbid factors.
  - Useful for tracking changes in severity.
- Limitations:
  - Less diagnostic precision; better suited for research or symptom monitoring.
  - Requires interpretation of subscale scores, which may be less intuitive for non-experts.

Conclusion: Good for multidimensional assessments but less diagnostic precision than PHQ-9 or MINI.

# Step-by-Step Recommendation

1. Diagnostic Accuracy (Highest Sensitivity & Specificity):
   - MINI outperforms all others for diagnosing depression, with the highest sensitivity and specificity against the gold standard. However, it is resource-intensive and impractical for frequent self-assessment.
2. Best for Screening:
   - PHQ-9 strikes the best balance between ease of use, sensitivity (88%), and specificity (85%), making it ideal for self-assessment and monitoring.
3. For Specialized Contexts:
   - HADS is valuable in hospital or medical settings where somatic symptoms may confound results.
4. For Symptom Monitoring Across Domains:
   - DASS-21 is excellent for understanding the interplay between depression, anxiety, and stress but is less precise for pure depression diagnosis.

# Final Answer

- For routine self-assessment and screening, PHQ-9 provides the highest combination of sensitivity and specificity for depression.
- For diagnostic purposes, especially in clinical settings, MINI is superior but requires professional administration.
