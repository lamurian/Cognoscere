- Various guideline address data quality issues for studies using real-world evidence data: CADTH, EMA, FDA, Health Canada, NICE
- Key challenges:
  - Eligibility criteria: Population do not perfectly match those in trials
  - Temporal alignment: Standard of care may evolve over time and affect the outcomes across different time frames
  - Data quality and clinical evaluation consistency: Missing data, inaccuracies, incompleteness
  - Population representation: Cohort does not represent the diversity in the population
  - Endpoint comparability and meaningfulness
  - Regulatory and ethical considerations
- [AI role](Resources/navigating-LLM-for-HEOR.md):
  - Synthetic data using generative adversarial networks
  - NLP and LLM to improve model building
  - Machine learning approaches for improved matching between RCT, cohort, and the population
- Real world data according to the FDA:
  - Electronic health record^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046423000643]
  - Medical claims data
  - Product and disease registries
  - Patient-generated data, including in-home settings
  - Data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, e.g. from case reports/social media
