- Definition:
  - In medicine: The set of observable and measurable characteristics of an individual, and can be caused or modified by disease
  - In data science: A specification of an observable, *viz.* a changing state of an organism, e.g. from healthy to sick
- Disease phenotype as data:
  - There are multiple terminologies across different domains and codes, e.g. LOINC, ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, etc.
  - One disease is representable by multiple phenotypes, for instance, a disease can be described by its symptoms, diagnostic lab results, medication uses, or complications
  - Increasing availability facilitates exploration of disease-medicine-outcome relationships.
- Phenotyping Process:
  - A systematic, transparent method ensures reproducibility and reliability.
  - Includes creating/validating disease phenotypes and generating patient cohorts.
