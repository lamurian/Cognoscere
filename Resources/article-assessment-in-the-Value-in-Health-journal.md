  - Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of an intervention that draws conclusions about methods
  - Systematic review that follows a very high standard, i.e. by critically reviewing and synthesizing the literature
  - Cost effectiveness analyses that use innovative methods or very important to practitioners or policymakers
- Steps of evaluation based on importance:
  - Align with the journal's scope?
  - Represent a novel contribution?
  - Use rigorous methods?
  - Communicate its main message effectively?
  - Avoid bias or a marketing message?
  - Use English language and grammar appropriately?
- Creating a highlight points, each in one sentence:
