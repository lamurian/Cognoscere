- Pain of systematic literature review:
  - Time consuming
  - Labor intensive
- [AI can help as an assistant, but need human expertise to validate the findings](Resources/LLM-as-the-next-frontier-in-health-economic-modelling-conceptualization.md) 
  - Enhance the search strategy
  - Automatic screening to highlight important parts of the abstract
  - Assess bias
  - Extract the results $\to$ Not very good at interpreting tables or figures
  - Generate codes for further analysis
  - Draft reports $\to$ LLM excels at summarizing and writing
- Limitations:
  - Accuracy may vary depends on the prompt
  - Human oversight is essential
  - Reproducibility issues
  - Potential for bias
  - Data privacy risks
