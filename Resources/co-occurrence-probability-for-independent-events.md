In this scenario, we're describing a system where two independent events, $A$ and $B$, can occur for a given object $O$. The goal is to find the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur for the same object $O$.

Given that the probabilities of $A$ and $B$ are 0.3 and 0.1, respectively, and assuming the events $A$ and $B$ are independent, the probability that both events occur simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities.

Thus, the probability of both $A$ and $B$ occurring for the same object $O$ is:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B) = 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03
$$

So, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur for the same object $O$ is 0.03 or 3%.
