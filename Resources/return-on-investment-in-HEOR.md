# Current issues

- Healthcare and innovation is changing due to government and HTA influence
- There is an urgency to demonstrate the value of HEOR
- Changes in HEOR happens in all levels from the entry level to senior level
- Until now, no KPI or performance metrics for HEOR professionals
- Executive/company leaderships have the lowest understanding of HEOR values
- Key gaps in HEOR professionals' skills:
  - Business acumen and strategic thinking
  - Business communication

# HEOR benchmarking

- Evolving HEOR remits
  - Elevated importance of value evidence
  - Opportunities of applying HEOR expertise
  - Expansion of RWE responsibilities
  - HEOR analytics provide valuable insights
- Persisting chalenges:
  - Lack of understanding of HEOR
  - Perception of being overly academic and lack of effective dissemination
  - Organizational positioning continues to evolve
  - Limited seat at the table for driving strategies
- Key recommendations:
  - Develop strong communication skills
  - Invest in evidence generation and communication planning
  - Establish KPIs linked to business impacts
  - Be strategic thought partner for Value & Access function
  - Lead the governance of RWE

# HEOR in the industry

- Focus on translating science into simple messages
- HEOR professionals drive strategic implementation
- Topics of interest: How do we collaborate better in an organization?
- Needs: Expertise, collaboration, and communication
- LLM will transform the technical work
- Outsourcing modeller and analyst so that HEOR professionals can focus more on strategy, collaboration, and communication instead

# Measuring the return of investment

- $ROI = \frac{Revenue - Investment}{Investment} \times 100\%$
- However, total revenue attributable to HEOR works is not straightforward to calculate
