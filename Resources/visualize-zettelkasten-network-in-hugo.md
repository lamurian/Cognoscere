# Introduction

To visualize a Zettelkasten note network in Hugo, we’ll follow a structured approach to convert your markdown notes into a network graph. This process will involve [linking your notes](Resources/read-zettelkasten-link-using-python.md) within Hugo and integrating a JavaScript-based network visualization. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

# 1. Structure and Link Your Notes in Markdown

The Zettelkasten method relies on linking notes to form a network, so we’ll focus on organizing your markdown files with clear, unique identifiers (like `20231028-note-title.md`) for each note. 

1. **File Naming Convention**: Ensure each note has a unique filename (or identifier), making it easy to reference and link between them. Many Zettelkasten users include dates in the filenames, which works well for linking purposes.
   
2. **Linking Syntax**: Use markdown links (e.g., `[[20231028-note-title]]`) for internal references between notes. These references will later be used to establish connections in the network.

3. **Front Matter**: Each markdown file should include YAML or TOML front matter with metadata. This metadata can help Hugo recognize relationships between notes:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Note Title"
    date: 2023-10-28
    tags: ["topic1", "topic2"]
    references: ["20231029-other-note", "20231030-another-note"]
    ---
    ```
   Here, the `references` field lists linked notes, helping us later visualize these relationships.

# 2. Parse and Preprocess Data

Hugo doesn’t natively process note connections, so we’ll need to preprocess this data to create a JSON file that describes the relationships between notes.

1. **Custom Shortcode or Preprocessing Script**: Use a script (Python or Go is convenient) to scan the markdown files, extract the front matter, and identify relationships. For each note:
   - Parse `references` from the front matter.
   - Build a JSON object where each note is a node, and each link is an edge between nodes.

2. **Output Network Data in JSON Format**:
   The script should output a JSON file (`network.json`) with a structure like this:
    ```json
    {
      "nodes": [
        {"id": "20231028-note-title", "label": "Note Title"},
        {"id": "20231029-other-note", "label": "Other Note"}
      ],
      "edges": [
        {"source": "20231028-note-title", "target": "20231029-other-note"}
      ]
    }
    ```
   This JSON will be used by the frontend JavaScript library to render the network.

# 3. Integrate with Hugo’s Build Process

To automate JSON generation as part of the Hugo build, add your preprocessing script as a **build hook** or **makefile step** that runs before Hugo starts. If the JSON needs frequent updates, use a build pipeline (e.g., in npm or shell scripts) to regenerate `network.json` when markdown content changes.

# 4. Visualize the Network with JavaScript

Once the JSON data is ready, integrate a JavaScript network visualization library into your Hugo site. Options like **D3.js** or **vis.js** can create interactive, dynamic visualizations.

1. **Add the JSON to Hugo’s `static` Folder**: Place the generated `network.json` in Hugo’s `static` directory so it’s served as a static asset.
   
2. **Setup a Visualization Page in Hugo**:
   Create a Hugo layout template (`layouts/_default/network.html`) where the network will render. This page will:
   - Load `network.json`.
   - Use JavaScript to render the visualization.

3. **JavaScript for Visualization**:
   Include a script in your HTML template to load `network.json` and render it with `vis.js`:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <script src="https://unpkg.com/vis-network/standalone/umd/vis-network.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="network" style="height: 600px;"></div>
      <script>
        // Load JSON data
        fetch('/network.json')
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(data => {
            const nodes = new vis.DataSet(data.nodes);
            const edges = new vis.DataSet(data.edges);

            // Configure and initialize the network
            const container = document.getElementById('network');
            const networkData = { nodes: nodes, edges: edges };
            const options = {
              nodes: {
                shape: 'dot',
                size: 10,
                font: { size: 14 },
                color: { border: '#222', background: '#97C2FC' }
              },
              edges: { color: { color: '#222' } }
            };
            new vis.Network(container, networkData, options);
          });
      </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4. **Link to the Visualization Page**:
   Link this network visualization page from your homepage or a navigation bar, so users can easily access it. The page will display your notes network, where users can click on nodes to view individual notes.

# 5. Optional Enhancements

- **Interactive Node Clicks**: Enhance the visualization by linking each node to its respective Hugo-generated page. Modify the `network.json` to include URLs for each note, allowing users to click a node and navigate to the note’s full content.
- **Dynamic Updates**: For a constantly evolving Zettelkasten, automate the JSON generation process (e.g., with a `make` script or Hugo’s `exec` command) so that it updates whenever you add or change notes.

# Summary

1. Structure notes with a clear identifier and metadata for linking.
2. Use a preprocessing script to create `network.json`, detailing nodes and edges.
3. Integrate a JavaScript library (like `vis.js`) in a Hugo template to visualize the network.
4. Optionally, enhance interactivity with direct links from visualization nodes to individual notes.

This solution effectively bridges Hugo with a Zettelkasten-style network by leveraging Hugo’s markdown processing and JavaScript visualization, providing an interactive, connected browsing experience for your notes.
