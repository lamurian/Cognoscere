- Intestinal immune system is the key to the pathogenesis of [IBD](Resources/inflammatory-bowel-disease.md) 
- The intestinal epithelium is a mucosal layer that prevents antigen or bacteria to enter the bloodstream
- The intestinal epithelium has a sealed intercellular junctions
- In IBD, the intercellular junctions are defective due to:
  - Primary cause: Barrier function failure
  - Secondary cause: Severe inflammation
- Excessive inflammatory reactions $\to$ Deteriorates the intestinal epithelium $\to$ Exposure to microbes or antigens $\to$ Worse inflammation
