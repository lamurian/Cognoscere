# Resources

Golang is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. Here are some free resources to get started:

- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/): A hands-on introduction to Go using annotated example programs. Itâ€™s an excellent resource for learning Go with practical examples.
- [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1): An official interactive tutorial by the Go team. It walks you through the basics of Go step-by-step.
- [Go Programming Language Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/): The official Go documentation is well-written and comprehensive, offering guides, tutorials, and references.
- [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/): A free, open-source book that teaches Go by writing tests first. This is great for developers who prefer learning through test-driven development (TDD).
