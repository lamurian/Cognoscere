# Week 8: Deployment and Final Project Pomodoro Planner

This week will be focused on deploying your React widgets and integrating them into a static Hugo site. You will learn how to bundle your React widgets, deploy them to a hosting platform, and integrate them into your Hugo site to create a cohesive experience.

---

# Day 1: Preparing for Deployment (3 hours)  

## Goal: Learn how to bundle React widgets and prepare them for deployment.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Introduction to bundling React with Vite/Webpack.  
  - Understand how Vite/Webpack can be used to bundle your React app into a standalone JavaScript file.  
  - Learn how to configure the build process in Vite/Webpack.  
- Task: Set up your project for production and build the React widget using Vite or Webpack.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Build and optimize your React widget for deployment.  
  - Learn how to configure the build settings for smaller bundle sizes, optimizations, and production-ready assets.  
- Task: Run the production build command (e.g., `vite build` or `npm run build`) and ensure that everything is bundled correctly.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Testing the build.  
  - Run the production build locally to ensure everything works as expected (e.g., widget loads correctly, API requests are functional).  
- Task: Test the built React widget by serving it locally using a static server (e.g., `vite preview` or `serve` command).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Finalize the build and prepare it for deployment.  
  - Ensure there are no broken links or errors before moving forward with deployment.

# Day 2: Deploying React Widget (3 hours)  

## Goal: Deploy your React widget to a hosting platform.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Introduction to deployment options (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Vercel).  
  - Learn how to deploy your React app to a platform like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel.  
- Task: Choose a deployment platform and prepare your React app for deployment.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Deploying with Netlify.  
  - Set up a Netlify account and connect your project to GitHub.  
  - Learn how to deploy the production build to Netlify.  
- Task: Deploy your React widget to Netlify.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Deploying with GitHub Pages.  
  - Set up GitHub Pages to host your widget.  
  - Learn how to deploy your widget using GitHub Actions or a manual deployment process.  
- Task: Deploy your React widget to GitHub Pages (or similar platform).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test the deployed React widget on your platform and ensure it's functioning correctly (API calls, responsiveness).

# Day 3: Integrating React Widget into Hugo (3 hours)  

## Goal: Integrate the React widget into a Hugo static site.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Introduction to Hugo templates.  
  - Learn the basics of Hugo’s templating system (how to embed static files into pages).  
  - Understand how Hugo serves static assets (JS, CSS) in your templates.  
- Task: Set up a Hugo project or use an existing one.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Embedding React widget in Hugo templates.  
  - Learn how to include the React widget (JavaScript and HTML) into Hugo templates using `<script>` and `<div>` tags.  
- Task: Embed your React widget into a Hugo template by adding a `<script>` tag for the bundled JS file and a `<div>` for rendering the widget.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Testing the widget within Hugo.  
  - Test the integration of the React widget into the Hugo site to ensure it loads correctly and functions as expected.  
- Task: Debug any issues that arise during integration (e.g., CORS issues, missing dependencies).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Finalize the integration and ensure smooth functioning within the Hugo site.  

---

# Day 4: Debugging and Polishing the Integration (3 hours)  

## Goal: Ensure the widget works flawlessly within the Hugo site.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Debugging integration issues.  
  - Identify any potential issues with embedding the React widget into the Hugo site (e.g., script loading order, missing assets).  
- Task: Debug and fix any issues preventing the widget from working correctly.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Cross-browser testing.  
  - Ensure that the widget is responsive and functional across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).  
- Task: Test the widget in different browsers and make any necessary adjustments.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Polishing the Hugo site integration.  
  - Optimize the Hugo site and widget for better performance (minifying CSS/JS, using a CDN for assets).  
- Task: Refine the user experience (e.g., loading indicators, error messages, mobile responsiveness).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Conduct final testing and prepare for production deployment of the Hugo site with the embedded React widget.

# Day 5: Final Deployment of Hugo Site (3 hours)  

## Goal: Deploy the complete Hugo site with the integrated React widget.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Preparing for Hugo site deployment.  
  - Build your Hugo site and prepare the static files for deployment.  
- Task: Run `hugo` to generate the static files for your site.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Deploying the Hugo site.  
  - Choose a deployment platform for Hugo (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).  
  - Deploy the Hugo site to your chosen platform.  
- Task: Deploy the site and ensure that everything is working smoothly.  

Pomodoro 3:
