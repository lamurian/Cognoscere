- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease
- IBD affects the gastrointestinal tract
- IBD is divided into:
  - [Crohn's Disase](Resources/Crohn-disease.md) 
  - [Ulcerative Colitis](Resources/ulcerative-colitis.md) 
- IBD occurs after an exaggerated immune response to normal stimulus, e.g. food and intestinal flora
