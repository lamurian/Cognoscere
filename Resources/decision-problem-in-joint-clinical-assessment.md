- Cross-over in RCT creates complexity and introduces bias $\to$ Requires external control studies
- EU HTA CG guidance on external control studies has limited guidance on the methods of incorporating ITC or RWD
- Before incorporating RWD, it is important to quantify the bias
- Quantitative bias analysis: Testing sensitivity by quantifying strength of bias to reach a certain threshold (e.g. the threshold of OR = 1)
- JCA: Guideline for quantitative evidence synthesis - requirements for reporting:
  - Section 3.2.1
  - Section 5.2
- Issues with RWD:
  - Typically not collecting adverse effects
  - Typically not collecting HRQoL
