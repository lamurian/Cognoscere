# Week 2: Intermediate JavaScript Pomodoro Planner

This plan allocates Pomodoros to mastering APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and modern ES6+ features. You'll also enhance your to-do list app as a hands-on project.

---

# Day 1: Introduction to APIs and Fetch (3 hours)  

## Goal: Learn how to fetch data and interact with APIs.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Basics of APIs and HTTP methods.  
  - Learn about GET and POST requests.  
  - Understand REST APIs and how to use endpoints.  
- Resources: Use tutorials/documentation (e.g., MDN Fetch API).  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Fetch API basics.  
  - Learn `fetch()` syntax and `.then()` for handling responses.  
  - Understand JSON and how to parse it.  
- Task: Fetch and log data from a simple public API (e.g., https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Practice: Display fetched data on a webpage.  
  - Build a script to fetch and display a random joke from a joke API.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Reflect and refine. Debug any issues you faced with `fetch()`.  

---

# Day 2: ES6+ Features (3 hours)  

## Goal: Learn modern JavaScript syntax for cleaner, more efficient code.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Template literals and destructuring.  
  - Use template literals for string interpolation.  
  - Understand destructuring for arrays and objects.  
- Task: Rewrite old code to use template literals and destructuring.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Spread/rest operators.  
  - Learn to combine arrays and objects using the spread operator.  
  - Understand how to use the rest operator in functions.  
- Task: Create a script that merges two arrays and finds the largest number in the combined array.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Focus: Modules and `import/export`.  
  - Understand how to split code into modules.  
- Task: Modularize a small script (e.g., separate DOM manipulation and logic into different files).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review ES6+ concepts and refactor old projects using new features.  

---

# Day 3: Promises and Async/Await (3 hours)  

## Goal: Understand and use asynchronous JavaScript.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Basics of Promises.  
  - Learn the `Promise` syntax.  
  - Understand `.then()` and `.catch()` for handling success and errors.  
- Task: Create a fake API call using a `Promise` that resolves after a delay.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: `async/await` syntax.  
  - Learn how `async/await` simplifies handling Promises.  
  - Use `try/catch` for error handling.  
- Task: Rewrite the fake API call using `async/await`.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Practice: Combine Promises and APIs.  
  - Fetch data from an API and handle errors gracefully.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test and refine your code.  

---

# Day 4: API Project (3 hours)  

## Goal: Build a small project using APIs and async/await.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Design and setup.  
  - Plan a webpage to fetch and display data (e.g., weather details for a city).  
  - Write HTML and basic CSS for the structure.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Fetch data using an API.  
  - Use `fetch()` and `async/await` to get weather details for a city.  
- Task: Display data dynamically on the webpage.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Enhancements: Add error handling for invalid city names or API failures.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Test your project and debug issues.  

---

# Day 5: To-Do List App Enhancements (3 hours)  

## Goal: Enhance your to-do list app with new features.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Focus: Add local storage.  
  - Learn to save and retrieve tasks using `localStorage`.  
- Task: Save tasks to `localStorage` so they persist after a page reload.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Focus: Implement additional functionality.  
  - Add a "Clear Completed Tasks" button.  
- Task: Test and debug.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Enhancements: Refactor code to use ES6+ features.  
  - Use modules and destructuring for cleaner code.  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Review and finalize.  

---

# Day 6: Review and Consolidation (3 hours)  

## Goal: Solidify knowledge and integrate concepts.

Pomodoro 1:  
- Review Promises, `async/await`, and APIs.  

Pomodoro 2:  
- Add documentation and comments to the projects.  

Pomodoro 3:  
- Optional: Try another small API project (e.g., fetching and displaying user data).  

Pomodoro 4:  
- Plan for next week based on your progress.

# Day 7: Rest or Bonus Practice  

Take a break or revisit unfinished tasks.
