# Week 1: Core JavaScript Basics Pomodoro Planner

With your weekly hours (10–15 hours) and focus on building JavaScript fundamentals, we'll allocate Pomodoro intervals to learning, practicing, and building projects. Each session will include short 5-minute breaks between Pomodoros and a longer 15-minute break after completing 4 Pomodoros.
