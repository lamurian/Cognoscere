# Migliavaca et al., *Meta‚Äêanalysis of Prevalence.*
- Meta-analysis of prevalence may have a larger $I^2$ statistics
- Contributing factors are the higher number of included studies and non-extreme pooled estimates (between 10% and 90%)
- Reporting prediction interval is essential
- Recall that: ![[Avoiding common mistakes in meta-analysis#^270370]]
	- It reflects the amount to which confidence interval for individual study estimates overlap with one another
	- Significant overlap of CI $\to$ Low $I^2$
	- Minimal overlap of CI $\to$ High $I^2$
	- Large sample size $\to$ Narrow CI $\to$ Tends not to overlap $\to$ High $I^2$
