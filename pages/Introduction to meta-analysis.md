# Borenstein et al., _Introduction to Meta‚ÄêAnalysis_.

- Results of subgroup meta-analysis and independent meta-analysis on subsets of the data may differ
- When fitting independent meta-analysis models, where the error may differ from one model to another
- While a subgroup meta-analysis is similar to one-regressor meta-regression where the error is the same for all subgroups
	- Technically, subgroup meta-analysis is performed by fitting independent models first
	- The independent models are meta-analyzed using either fixed or random-effect model
	- As such, subgroup meta-analysis can provide both individual and overall weight/variance
- The goal of subgroup meta-analysis is either of:
	- Calculate the combined summary effect
	- Compare the individual effect (within-group summary + between-group difference)
