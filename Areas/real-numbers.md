The following listed hierarchy simplifies the element of real numbers.

Real numbers:
- Irrational numbers
- Rational numbers:
  - Integers:
    - Whole numbers
      - Natural numbers

It's easier to imagine numbers using the smallest subset, i.e. the natural number. Natural number is the number we use for counting, which *naturally* starts from 1, hence $\mathbb{N} = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$. When we introduce $0$ to the natural number, we obtain the whole number, hence $\mathbb{W} = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...$. Complementing the set with their additive inverse ^[For example, -1 is the additive inverse of 1] results in the integers, hence $\mathbb{Z} = ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...$.

So far, we see that these numbers are discretely spaced. For instance, there is nothing in between 0 and 1, or -1 and -2. Values between integers are the rational and irrational numbers. Rational means that the numbers can be written as the *ratio* of two integers. For example, $0.25$ is the rational numbers, which can be represented as $\frac{1}{4}$. In that sense, irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be represented by the ratio of two integers. These numbers usually are imperfect roots, for example $\sqrt{12} \cong 3.464101...$.
