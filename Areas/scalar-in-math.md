Scalar is a number. Any constant or its abstract representation is a scalar in math. A scalar is a unit of measure of anything, i.e. a *magnitude*. In essence, scalar is a building block with a computational property. The computational property makes it possible to perform mathematics operation on a scalar. For example, let there be a scalar of $1$, then we can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, to name a few among others.

# Mathematics operation

The mathematics operation in a scalar is straightforward, as we only have to perform the operation element-wise. Suppose that we have two scalars of $x = 3$ and $y = 4$, we can apply the following operations:

- $x + y = 3 + 4 = 7$
- $x - y = 3 - 4 = -1$
- $x \times y = 3 \times 4 = 12$
- $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75$
