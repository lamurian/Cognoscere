# Key responsibilities

You will work with a wide variety of clients to deliver the latest data science and big data technologies including GenerativeAI / LLM capabilities. Your teams will design and build scalable solutions for healthcare clients that unify, enrich, and derive insights from varied data sources across a broad technology landscape. You will help our clients navigate the complex world of modern data science, analytics, and software engineering.  Weâ€™ll look to you to provide guidance and perform technical development tasks to ensure data science solutions are properly engineered and maintained to support the ongoing business needs of our clients. 

You will be joining a dynamic and interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers who love to tackle the most challenging computational problems for our clients. We love to think creatively, build applications efficiently, and collaborate in both the ideation of solutions and the pursuit of new opportunities. Many on our team have advanced academic degrees or equivalent experience in industry. 

# When to apply

EY accepts applications for this position on an on-going basis. If you can demonstrate that you meet the criteria above, please contact us as soon as possible.

# 6-month learning path

## **Phase 1: Foundational Projects (Month 1-2)**  

**Objective**: Solidify expertise in healthcare-focused AI/ML and foundational tools like Python, ML workflows, and cloud-based data solutions.  

### **Activities**  

1. **Healthcare Data Analysis Project**  
   - Analyze public healthcare datasets (e.g., COVID-19, patient outcomes) to identify insights using Python and ML libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.  
   - Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Tableau for visualization.  
   - **Deliverable**: Publish a LinkedIn post: *"Using Python to Analyze and Visualize Healthcare Data: A Step-by-Step Guide."*  

2. **Building an ML Pipeline**  
   - Develop a complete machine learning pipeline (data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation) for a healthcare use case, such as predicting patient readmission.  
   - Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS or Azure) to deploy this pipeline.  
   - **Deliverable**: Post a mini-project walkthrough: *"Deploying a Predictive Model for Healthcare on Azure: Lessons Learned."*  

3. **Generative AI for Health**  
   - Implement a simple Generative AI project using OpenAI APIs (e.g., summarizing medical notes or generating patient education materials).  
   - Use frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex to enhance results.  
   - **Deliverable**: Share insights in a post: *"How Generative AI Can Revolutionize Patient Care: A Hands-On Example."*

## **Phase 2: Advanced Techniques and Tools (Month 3-4)**  

**Objective**: Demonstrate mastery of advanced ML concepts, Generative AI, and MLOps principles.  

### **Activities**  

1. **Fine-Tune Generative AI Models**  
   - Fine-tune an open-source language model (e.g., GPT-J) for a healthcare-specific task like clinical text classification or sentiment analysis.  
   - Document the workflow, including challenges and insights.  
   - **Deliverable**: Write a post: *"Fine-Tuning Generative AI Models for Healthcare: My Experiment with GPT-J."*  

2. **CI/CD in ML Projects**  
   - Create a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to automate model retraining and deployment.  
   - Highlight how this workflow can ensure real-time updates for healthcare applications.  
   - **Deliverable**: Publish: *"How CI/CD Can Improve ML Deployment in Healthcare: A Practical Guide."*  

3. **MLOps and MLFlow Integration**  
   - Use MLFlow to track experiments and manage models in a healthcare project.  
   - Focus on reproducibility and scalability.  
   - **Deliverable**: Post a tutorial: *"Mastering MLOps with MLFlow: A Real-World Healthcare Application."*  

---

## **Phase 3: Scaling and Deployment (Month 5-6)**  

**Objective**: Showcase real-world applications by scaling models, using cloud platforms, and demonstrating industry-relevant expertise.  

### **Activities**  

1. **Containerization and Scaling with Docker**  
   - Containerize a healthcare ML model and deploy it using Docker.  
   - Explore scaling it with Kubernetes or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  
   - **Deliverable**: Share: *"Scaling AI Models for Healthcare Using Docker: My Experience."*  

2. **End-to-End ML Workflow Deployment**  
   - Build an end-to-end workflow for a specific healthcare problem (e.g., detecting diabetic retinopathy using deep learning).  
   - Use cloud tools like AWS SageMaker, GCP AI Platform, or Azure ML.  
   - **Deliverable**: Write a case study post: *"Building an End-to-End ML Solution for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection."*  

3. **Cross-Disciplinary Insights**  
   - Collaborate with colleagues in healthcare or research to create a mock solution that integrates AI/ML into existing healthcare workflows.  
   - Highlight interdisciplinary skills.  
   - **Deliverable**: Publish a thought leadership post: *"Integrating AI into Healthcare Workflows: Challenges and Opportunities."*
