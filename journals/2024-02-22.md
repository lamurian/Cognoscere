- Sometimes we might encounter negative prediction interval in a meta-analysis of prevalence
- It reflects heightened dispersion due to inflated $\tau^2$ and/or standard error in the individual study
- It is best to truncate the prediction interval to fit in the logical bound, i.e. 0-100% for prevalence
- Negative prediction interval does not imply negative prevalence, which would not make any sense either
- Negative prediction interval suggests that the data varies too much!
