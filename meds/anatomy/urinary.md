title: "The #Anatomy of Urinary System"
---

The #anatomy of urinary system encompasses the upper and lower tract, where the blood is filtered of its wastes/byproducts. When we ingest and extract the nutritional components of our food, the unneeded components are then excreted through the [[physiology/gastrointestinal|gastrointestinal]] system or the [[haematology|blood]]. To understand the #physiology of the [[physiology/urinary|urinary tract]], a comprehension of its #anatomy is desirable.

# Kidney

We have two kidneys, each located on the flank of our body. Our kidneys take the shape of a bean, but roughly in the size of our fist. It sits slightly below our rib cage, taking the [posterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior) part (backside) of our body. From the image below, we can see that the left kidney is located below the spleen while the right kidney is below the liver.
