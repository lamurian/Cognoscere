# The #Anatomy of the Urinary System

The #anatomy of urinary system encompasses the upper and lower tract, where the blood is filtered of its wastes/byproducts. When we ingest and extract the nutritional components of our food, the unneeded components are then excreted through the [[physiology/gastrointestinal|gastrointestinal]] system or the [[haematology|blood]]. To understand the #physiology of the [[physiology/urinary|urinary tract]], a comprehension of its #anatomy is desirable.

## Kidney

We have two kidneys, each located on the flank of our body. Our kidneys take the shape of a bean, but roughly in the size of our fist. It sits slightly below our rib cage, taking the [posterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior) part (the backside) of our body. From the image below, we can see that the left kidney is located below the spleen, while the right kidney is below the liver.

The inside of each pair of kidney is highly intricate, where we can find incoming renal artery and outgoing renal vein. Running along the vessels is the nervous system, and we can see a collecting duct close by. The vessels are bifurcated into smaller vessels, and will later filtered in the glomerulus.
