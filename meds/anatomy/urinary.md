# The #Anatomy of the Urinary System

The #anatomy of urinary system encompasses the upper and lower tract, where the blood is filtered of its wastes/byproducts. When we ingest and extract the nutritional components of our food, the unneeded components are then excreted through the [[physiology/gastrointestinal|gastrointestinal]] system or the [[haematology|blood]]. To understand the #physiology of the [[physiology/urinary|urinary tract]], a comprehension of its #anatomy is desirable.

## Kidney

We have two kidneys, each located on the flank of our body. Our kidneys take the shape of a bean, but roughly in the size of our fist. It sits partly below our rib cage, occupying the [posterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location#Anterior_and_posterior) part (the backside) of our body. From the image below, we can see that the left kidney is located below the spleen, while the right kidney is below the liver. The left kidney is located posteriorly at approximately T12 -> L13. If we draw an imaginary line aligning both kidneys, the right kidney is located slightly below the left kidney due to its anatomical adjacency to the liver.

The inside of each pair of kidney is highly intricate, where we can find incoming renal artery and outgoing renal vein. Running along the vessels is the nervous system, and we can see a collecting duct close by. The large vessels are bifurcated into smaller vessels, and will later be filtered in the glomerulus. The kidney weighs differently in males and females, with males having a heavier pair of kidney, though similarly shaped. We capture the overall profile of one kidney in the following table:

| Property       | Measurement |
| :------------- | :---------: |
| Weigh (male)   | 125 - 175 g |
| Weigh (female) | 115 - 155 g |
| Length         | 11 - 14 cm  |
| Width          | 6 cm        |
| Thickness      | 4 cm        |

Each kidney is encapsulated by dense, irregular, fibrous connective tissue that protect the kidney. On top of the connective tissue, we can find the renal fat pad which absorb corporal trauma and mechanical shock. On the outer layer, there is a tough renal fascia which together with peritoneum secure the kidney position. On the "peak" of each kidney, there lies an adrenal gland, looking like a cap covering the head.
