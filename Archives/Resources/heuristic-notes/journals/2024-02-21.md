- Today I learn about (dis-)similarities between Obsidian and Logseq
- Though Logseq seems promising, its app is a bit cumbersome to use
- I reconfigured the content directory in Obsidian to follow a flat structure as used in Logseq
- The goal is to ensure that both app can be used interchangeably when needed
- I optimized the use of `tags` in the `property` field, i.e. the `YAML` header
