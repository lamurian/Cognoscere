title: Taking note with `vim` and #markdown
---

# Vim and #markdown

I've been using `vim` for quite some time, and I really enjoy the agility in its keybinding movements. Wherever possible, I have the tendency of using `vim` (or at least its keybindings) in my day-to-day work because it's highly intuitive and has been partly engrained in my muscle memory. Of course, then I have the urge to implement `vim` in my note-taking workflow. I've been successfully integrated `vim` for simple and quick note-taking purposes; however, building my own personal wiki is another challenge to tackle on. Though still a work in progress, in [[sync-obsidian-with-git#How far do I get with Obsidian|synchronize Obsidian with git]] I ventured a method to dynamically sync my notes across devices.
