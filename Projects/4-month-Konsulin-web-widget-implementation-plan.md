## **Month 1: Skill Building and Planning**

### **Weeks 1–2: Setting the Foundation**

**Goal**: Strengthen your JavaScript skills and learn React basics.

#### **Milestones**:

- Understand JavaScript syntax and DOM manipulation.
- Build a basic React component and learn how to manage state.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **Learn Vanilla JavaScript**:
   - Focus on ES6+ features like `let`/`const`, arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals.
   - Practice manipulating the DOM (e.g., showing/hiding elements, updating text).
2. **Experiment with Fetch API**:
   - Write a small script to fetch data from a public API and display it dynamically in HTML.
3. **Install React Environment**:
   - Use `create-react-app` or **Vite** to set up your React project.
   - Create a simple React component that renders some static text.
4. **React Basics**:
   - Learn `useState` and `useEffect` hooks by building a counter app.
   - Understand props and how to pass data between components.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A React app with at least one component dynamically fetching and displaying data.

### **Weeks 3–4: Project Planning and Backend Understanding**

**Goal**: Plan the widget features and learn to interact with your FHIR backend.

#### **Milestones**:

- Understand the FHIR API endpoints and structure.
- Define the features and layout of your widget.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **FHIR API Exploration**:
   - Familiarize yourself with key endpoints of your FHIR backend (e.g., `Patient`, `Observation`).
   - Use a tool like Postman or Insomnia to test FHIR API requests.
2. **Widget Feature Definition**:
   - Decide what the widget will do. For example:
     - Fetch and display patient data.
     - Allow search or filtering by patient name.
     - Display recent observations for a selected patient.
3. **Design the Widget Layout**:
   - Create a wireframe or sketch of your widget. Tools like Figma or simple pen and paper can work.
   - Decide how the user interacts with the widget.
4. **React with FHIR**:
   - Write a simple React app that fetches data from your FHIR backend and displays it in a table.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A detailed plan for your widget's features and UI layout.
- A working React app fetching data from your FHIR backend.

## **Month 2: Widget Core Development**

### **Weeks 5–6: Build the Core Functionality**

**Goal**: Build the basic widget structure and integrate it with the FHIR backend.

#### **Milestones**:

- Fetch and display FHIR data dynamically.
- Implement basic UI interactions like search and filter.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **Build the Data Fetching Logic**:
   - Use the FHIR API to fetch patient data and display it in a table or list format.
   - Use React’s `useEffect` for data fetching.
   - Use `axios` for cleaner HTTP requests.
2. **Create Interactive UI**:
   - Add a search bar or filter to allow users to filter patients by name or other attributes.
   - Use React’s `useState` to store and update the search input and filtered results.
3. **Style the UI**:
   - Use CSS frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** or **Material-UI** for a polished look.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A functional React widget displaying patient data with basic interactivity.
- A visually styled UI with a search/filter feature.

---

### **Weeks 7–8: Add State Management and Error Handling**

**Goal**: Enhance the widget with robust state management and error handling.

#### **Milestones**:

- Manage widget state effectively.
- Implement error handling for API calls.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **State Management**:
   - Manage the widget’s data (e.g., patients list, loading state, search input) using `useState` or React Context API if needed.
   - Display a loading spinner while fetching data.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Handle network errors or empty API responses gracefully (e.g., show error messages or "no data" placeholders).
3. **Optimize Data Fetching**:
   - Debounce the search input to reduce API calls.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A stable widget with improved state management and robust error handling.

## **Month 3: Advanced Features and Security**

### **Weeks 9–10: Authentication Integration**

**Goal**: Secure the widget by integrating an authentication mechanism.

#### **Milestones**:

- Implement user login/logout functionality.
- Use authentication tokens for secure API calls.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **Choose an Auth Provider**:
   - Use **Firebase Auth**, **Auth0**, or OAuth to secure API requests.
   - Learn how to handle login/logout flows in React.
2. **Secure API Calls**:
   - Use the access token to authenticate FHIR API requests.
   - Implement token refresh mechanisms if required.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A React widget that authenticates users before fetching FHIR data.

---

### **Weeks 11–12: Add Advanced Interactivity**

**Goal**: Enhance user interaction with dynamic UI updates.

#### **Milestones**:

- Add features like dropdowns, modals, or charts.
- Make the widget more user-friendly and intuitive.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **Dynamic Features**:
   - Add a dropdown to select patients or data categories.
   - Use libraries like **React Modal** for popups (e.g., view detailed patient data).
2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use a charting library like **Chart.js** or **Recharts** to display patient metrics visually.
   - Integrate graphs for trends in patient observations.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A feature-rich widget with dropdowns, modals, or charts for enhanced user experience.

---

## **Month 4: Finalization and Deployment**

### **Weeks 13–14: Testing and Optimization**

**Goal**: Test, optimize, and prepare your widget for deployment.

#### **Milestones**:

- Ensure the widget works on different devices and browsers.
- Optimize performance.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the widget on multiple devices and browsers (use tools like BrowserStack).
   - Validate the API responses to ensure no edge cases are missed.
2. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Use lazy loading for components or data fetching.
   - Minimize the bundle size with tree-shaking and code splitting.
3. **Final Styling**:
   - Ensure your widget has a polished, responsive design.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A fully tested and optimized widget ready for deployment.

### **Weeks 15–16: Deployment and Integration**

**Goal**: Deploy the widget and integrate it into your Hugo site.

#### **Milestones**:

- Successfully host the widget.
- Embed it into your static Hugo site.

#### **Actionable Steps**:

1. **Widget Deployment**:
   - Use **Vite** or **Webpack** to bundle the widget into a single JavaScript file.
   - Host the widget on a CDN or as part of your Hugo site.
2. **Hugo Integration**:
   - Embed the widget into your Hugo templates using `<script>` and `<div>` tags.
   - Ensure it works seamlessly within the static site.

#### **Deliverables**:

- A deployed widget embedded in your Hugo site and accessible to end users.

### **Final Deliverables**

By the end of 4 months, you’ll have:
1. A secure, fully functional React widget fetching and displaying data from your FHIR backend.
2. A polished, user-friendly UI integrated into your Hugo site.
3. A deployable solution with proper authentication and robust error handling.
