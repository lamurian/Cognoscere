Good parameters should be:

- Interpretable, have a direct implication to the simulated agent
- Measurable, can be represented as numbers
- Well fitting, demonstrated by acceptable goodness of fit criteria
- Obtained from explanatory models, follow these steps in sequence to choose the right model to derive its parameters:
  1. Acceptable goodness of fit
  1. Good predictive power
  1. As simple as it is still deemed adequate, i.e., has less variables

Bad parameters would be:

- Meaningless
- Purely descriptive, no explanatory remark
