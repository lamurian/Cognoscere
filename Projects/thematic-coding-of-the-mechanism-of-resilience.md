- Theme and coding hierarchy:
  - Resource utilization and dynamics
    - Dynamics
    - Conditional
    - Resourcefulness
  - Process of overcoming stress
    - Buffer
    - Adapting
    - Thriving
  - Discerning judgment
    - Positive anticipation

- Interpretation: An adequate resource is necessary to circumvent stressful event and develop resilience

# Codebook

- Dynamics: The dynamics of resilience and how some factors may influence the capacity to deal with arising negative impact of stressful life events
- Conditional: Condition in which resilience may or may not take place
- Resourcefulness: Resource allocation and utilization as the main internal (psychological) capital
- Buffer: Remediation of the direct impact of stressful life events
- Adapting: A short-term positive outcome after successfully circumventing stressful life events
- Thriving: A long-term positive outcome after successfully circumventing stressful life events
- Positive anticipation: A discerning judgment on situations as a learned skill after previous stressful life events
- Time dependent: The presence of impact after previously bouncing back from stressful life events

# Coding example

Example 1:

- Tag: Resilience.Mechanism
- Content: *Resilience buffered* the relation between acculturative *stress* and somatization
- Keywords: Resilience buffers stress
- Coding logic: In the content, *buffer* implies the active mechanism of resilience
- Code: Buffer
- Thematic logic: Resilience as a buffer during stress implies the *process of overcoming stress*
- Theme: Process of overcoming stress

Example 2:

- Tag: Resilience.Mechanism
- Content: individuals with higher levels of resilience exhibited greater sensitivity to external pressures, which results in heightened reactivity when employing such coping mechanisms. According to the afective-signaling hypothesis, there is a bidirectional relationship between afect and cognitive control (Dignath et al., 2020). This means that the amplifcation of negative afect caused by stress is not necessarily maladaptive, as commonly assumed; instead, it can *motivate individuals* to take *adaptive actions* in response
- Keywords: Promote adaptive actions
- Coding logic: In the content, the presence of negative affect motivates individuals to take *adaptive* actions, implying that the ability to adapt as a short-term outcome of resilience
- Code: Adapting
- Thematic logic:
- Theme: Process of overcoming stress
