# Customer Relationships

1. **Community-Driven Engagement** – Konsulin will create a **community WhatsApp group** to foster a sense of belonging and support among users. This will serve as a space for users to connect, share experiences, and engage with Konsulin's mental health content. The WhatsApp group will also facilitate the delivery of **daily journaling prompts** and **periodic check-up reminders**, encouraging consistent usage and positive mental health practices.
2. **Automated Services** – Konsulin will provide **automated self-assessment tests** that users can take on their own time. These assessments will generate **personalized reports** that give users insights into their mental health status. This automation offers users the ability to track their progress, make informed decisions, and proactively manage their mental health in a secure and confidential manner.
3. **Mental Health Resources and Events** – Konsulin will use the WhatsApp group to share **relevant mental health events, resources, and educational materials**, offering users continuous value beyond just the tools. This helps build trust, encourages users to stay engaged, and keeps them informed on the latest mental health trends and strategies.

By combining **community-driven engagement** with **automated self-service options**, Konsulin will create a supportive ecosystem that empowers users to take charge of their mental health, while also offering them convenient and personalized tools.
