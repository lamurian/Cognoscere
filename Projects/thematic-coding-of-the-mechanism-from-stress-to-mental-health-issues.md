# Findings

- Tag: Problem.Impact.Mechanism
- Theme and coding hierarchy:
  - Decompensated resource utilization
    - Imbalance
    - Appraisal
  - Long-lasting impact of stress
    - Bidirectional causality
    - Symptoms dynamics
  - Reward-seeking behavior
    - Instant gratification
    - Substance use
- Interpretation: Stressful life events decompensate psychological resources and cause a long-lasting mental health impact, which in turn incite reward-seeking behavior

# Codebook

- Imbalance
- Appraisal
- Bidirectional causality
- Symptoms dynamics
- Instant gratification
- Substance use

# Coding example

Example 1:

- Tag: Problem.Impact.Mechanism
- Content: *use the SNS* as a means of stress relief or as a stress coping strategy to escape from reality and *compensate* for unsatisfactory social interactions when confronted with *excessive life stress*
- Keywords: SNS use, excessive life stress, compensation
- Coding logic: In the content, the use of SNS as a compensatory behavior amidst excessive stress implies the needs of an *instant gratification* to relief the stress
- Code: Instant gratification
- Thematic logic: The use of SNS as an instant gratification implies *reward-seeking behavior*
- Theme: Reward-seeking behavior

Example 2:

- Tag: Problem.Impact.Mechanism
- Content: poorer mental health outcomes in younger adults could be driven by their higher career demands, parental duties, and economic needs
- Keywords: Higher career demands, parental duties, economic needs
- Coding logic: In the content, the emphasis of higher career demand and other factors imply the presence of *imbalance* contributing to poorer mental health
- Code: Imbalance
- Thematic logic: The presence of imbalance decompensate internal resource to utilize when handling stressful life events
- Theme: Decompensated resource utilization
