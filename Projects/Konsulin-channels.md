# Channels

1. **User Acquisition via Clinicians in Partner Bureaus** – Konsulin will leverage **clinicians** within partner psychological bureaus to encourage patients to use the platform.

2. **Marketing via Blog and Social Media** – Konsulin will engage in **content marketing** through its blog, accessible at [https://konsulin.care/blog](https://konsulin.care/blog), and **social media** (Instagram and other platforms, with the handle @konsulin.care). These channels will be used to share mental health resources, educational content, and product updates, creating awareness and building a community around mental well-being.
3. **Communication via WhatsApp** – Communication with users will be facilitated through **WhatsApp groups** and a **WhatsApp Business account**. These channels will enable direct communication for reminders, journaling prompts, user engagement, and support. WhatsApp’s popularity in Indonesia makes it an effective channel for maintaining a personal, accessible connection with users.
4. **Service Delivery via Web App** – Konsulin’s **web app** at [https://app.konsulin.care](https://app.konsulin.care/) will be the main platform for delivering services such as self-assessments, personalized reports, and psychological journaling.
