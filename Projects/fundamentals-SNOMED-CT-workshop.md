- **Supporting ideas**:
  1. Constraints determine where an attribute can be applied and the values it can take.
  1. The ‘finding site’ attribute is an example with domain and range constraints.
  1. Domain constraints ensure attributes only apply to relevant concepts.
  1. Range constraints ensure attributes link to appropriate value sets (e.g., anatomical structures).
  1. These constraints maintain the integrity of clinical data and prevent errors.
- **Idea representation**:
  1. Flowchart showing domain and range constraints for an example attribute like "finding site."
  1. Visual linking "fever" to appropriate anatomical sites with constraints.

### Slide 4: Evolving Nature of the Concept Model  
- **Key ideas**: The Concept Model evolves with new attributes and refinements to meet clinical needs.
- **Supporting ideas**:
  1. Medical knowledge and clinical practices continuously drive changes in SNOMED CT.
  1. New attributes may be introduced to reflect emerging insights.
  1. Existing attributes may be refined for increased specificity and applicability.
  1. The evolving model helps SNOMED CT stay relevant and useful.
  1. Adaptability ensures the terminology remains aligned with healthcare advancements.
- **Idea representation**:
  1. Diagram showing the evolution of a concept with new attributes added over time.
  1. Visual timeline illustrating the Concept Model's adaptability to new medical knowledge.
