# Visual Identity for Konsulin  

The visual identity for Konsulin focuses on simplicity, calmness, and approachability. The charcoal and light gray colors ensure clarity and professionalism, while the turquoise and muted blue accents offer a sense of peace and positivity. The overall design language uses gentle typography, minimalist visuals, and user-friendly interfaces to create a space that feels both welcoming and expert-driven.

## 1. Font Choices

- Primary Font: Times  
  - Purpose: Professional, trustworthy, and timeless. This font exudes credibility and authority, making it a great fit for the more formal elements of Konsulin’s brand (such as headers or body text in educational content). It aligns with the "Knowledgeable Guide" part of Konsulin’s brand personality.
  - Usage: Headlines, callouts, and key informational content.
- Secondary Font: Plus Jakarta Sans  
  - Purpose: Friendly, modern, and approachable. This sans-serif font brings a sense of warmth and clarity, supporting Konsulin’s more conversational tone in social media posts and user engagement.
  - Usage: Body text, subheadings, social media posts, and informal messaging.

## 2. Color Palette

- Primary Foreground Color: Charcoal (`#161c26`)  
  - Purpose: A dark, neutral tone that conveys professionalism and calmness. It’s easy on the eyes and ensures readability, creating a sense of trust and stability.
  - Usage: Text, icons, and buttons.
- Primary Background Color: Soft Light Gray (`#eceff4`)
  - Purpose: Light, airy, and calming. This color provides a subtle background that doesn’t distract from the content. It evokes a sense of clarity and balance, making it perfect for an environment that’s meant to feel peaceful and welcoming.
  - Usage: Backgrounds for website, app, social media posts, and printed materials.
- Accent Color 1: Turquoise (`#0abdc3`)  
  - Purpose: Fresh, uplifting, and calming. This color represents the brand’s hopefulness and positivity. It adds vibrancy to the design without being overwhelming.
  - Usage: Buttons, highlights, links, call-to-action buttons, and icons. This color can be used sparingly to draw attention to key areas while maintaining the soothing aesthetic.
- Accent Color 2: Muted Blue (`#5e81ac`)  
  - Purpose: Balanced, serene, and supportive. It complements the turquoise and provides a grounding effect, reinforcing the calming and trustworthy nature of the brand.
  - Usage: Secondary buttons, icons, and accents. This can also be used in graphs or charts, providing visual clarity without feeling harsh.
- To maintain a harmonious and calming look, introduce a few subtle complementary shades:  
  - Soft Lavender (`#d0c9f7`): Used sparingly for text highlights or background accents.
  - Muted Peach (`#f7c0a0`): Ideal for gentle call-outs, error messages, or highlighting key notes.

## 3. Visual Elements

- Iconography  
  - Style: Use rounded, soft icons to make the interface more approachable and human-centered. Icons should be minimal but clear, representing mental health tools (e.g., journals, assessments, self-care exercises) in a straightforward yet friendly way.
  - Usage: Icons will appear on the app, website, and social media. For example, a heart icon for "self-compassion," a pencil icon for "journaling," and a brain icon for "mental health assessments."
- Imagery Style  
  - Concept: Use natural, calming images that align with the core message of mental wellness. Opt for abstract designs or serene, nature-based imagery (e.g., peaceful landscapes, soft clouds, calm seas) that evoke a sense of relaxation and clarity. Include photos of diverse people in comforting settings to promote inclusivity.
  - Usage: Background images on the website, app, and promotional materials. Photos used should convey inclusivity and a range of experiences, from professional settings to casual, personal moments.

## 4. Layout and Design Principles

- Simplicity and Minimalism  
  - Design elements should be clean and uncomplicated. A minimalist approach helps users focus on the content and feel calm. Avoid clutter and use white space effectively to create a sense of balance and ease.
  - Usage: Spacious layouts on the website, app, and social media, with clear, simple sections for easy navigation.
- User-Centered Design  
  - The design should prioritize the user’s experience. Each screen, page, or post should be intuitive and easy to navigate, reinforcing the accessibility and approachability of the brand.
  - Usage: Use large, legible text, intuitive icons, and call-to-action buttons that are easy to find and click, especially on mobile devices.
