# Meeting with #BDC and #Dev-247

![[Recording 20221011160701.webm]]

## Updates

- Regarding architecture, we have two options:
	- Use the working architecture from #Dev-247
		- Run on top of hadoop maintained locally by #Dev-247, not directly in cloud
		- Feasible to complete by December
	- Integrate with #BDC architecture
		- Run on a Kubernetes instance
		- Might take longer than December to complete
		- This should be done after the implementation on hadoop
- To expedite the development process, #Dev-247 will require pro-hire/rehiring because currently the team is occupied in a different project
- #Dev-247 will help optimize the landing page, but this issue will be revisited later on
