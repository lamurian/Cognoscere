This is a personal wiki repository, i.e. a knowledge base, containing short notes on medical science, computer stuffs, statistics, maths, pyschology, and others. I use this repository to synchronize my notes across all devices. I'm aiming to have a clean, consistent, and minimalist look for my notes, and the best example would be a [website by Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/). Currently, this repository only runs in Obsidian, but I will integrate my note-taking workflow with #hugo sooner or later so I can have a publishable note.
