# Background

This is a personal wiki repository, i.e. a knowledge base, containing short notes on medical science, computer stuffs, statistics, maths, pyschology, and others. I use this repository to synchronize my notes across all devices. I'm aiming to have a clean, consistent, and minimalist look for my notes, and the best example would be a [website by Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/). Currently, this repository only runs in Obsidian, but I will integrate my note-taking workflow with #hugo sooner or later so I can have a publishable note. This repository combines the [**PARA method**](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) with the [**Zettelkasten**](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) note-taking system to create a powerful framework for personal knowledge management.

## What is PARA?

The PARA method, developed by Tiago Forte, categorizes information into four distinct areas:

- **Projects**: Active tasks with specific goals and deadlines.
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities in various aspects of life.
- **Resources**: Useful materials, references, and knowledge that support your projects.
- **Archives**: Inactive items that can be revisited for insights or future use.

## What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten is a note-taking technique that emphasizes linking ideas and notes to foster connections and deeper understanding. By creating atomic notes and interlinking them, you build a dynamic web of knowledge that evolves over time.

## Why Combine Them?

Integrating PARA with Zettelkasten allows for structured organization while maintaining flexibility. This approach not only enhances your ability to manage ongoing projects but also fosters creative thinking and knowledge retention, making it easier to retrieve and connect information when you need it.

Join me in exploring how this combination can streamline your workflow and enhance your learning!
